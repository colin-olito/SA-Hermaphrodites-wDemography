## Abstract
Classic population genetics theory has been fundamental to understanding the evolution of sex-differences and the maintenance of sexually antagonistic (SA) genetic variation, but these models have rarely considered the demographic consequences of intralocus sexual antagonism. In this paper we develop a stage-structured mendelian matrix model and jointly analyze the evolutionary and demographic consequences of SA selection in obligately outcrossing (equivalent to dioecious/gonochorous) and partially selfing hermaphrodite populations. We focus on identifying parameter conditions under which SA polymorphisms are maintained by balancing selection *and* the population intrinsic growth rate remains positive. In addition, we analyze the effects of inbreeding depression manifesting in different life-history stages, and give an illustrative example of the potential for SA polymorphism in real populations using empirically estimated demographic rates for the hermaphroditic flowering plant *Mimulus guttatus*. Our results indicate that as population intrinsic growth rates approach one, large swathes of polymorphic parameter space become demographically inviable, and that inbreeding depression poses a significant challenge to the maintenance of SA polymorphism in partially selfing populations. Despite these demographic challenges, our example with *M. guttatus* appears to show that demographic rates observed in some real populations are capable of sustaining large regions of viable SA polymorphic space.
