The models also allow for the effects of inbreeding depression to manifest in several demographic parameters, allowing us to explore the fitness consequences of early- vs.~late-acting inbreeding depression.

%			\item Critically, largest deviations from pop.~gen.~predictions happen for predominantly selfing populations.
%			\item A perhaps obvious, but sometimes overlooked implication of our model predictions: selfing can offer reproductive assurance, and SA polymorphisms can be maintained in a non-trivial proportion of parameter space in partially selfing populations...

\section*{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Whether a population persists or goes extinct depends in large part on its ability to adapt to the environment. Yet, the process of adaptation can be impeded by a variety of genetic and environmental factors, including deleterious mutations \citep{Haldane1957}, environmental shifts causing a population to chase a new phenotypic optimum \citep{Maynard-Smith1976, LandeShannon1996,OrrUnckless2008}, maladaptive gene-flow \citep{KirkpatrickBarton1997, BolnickNosil2007}, as well as genetic constraints arising from intrinsic features of the inheritance system \citep{ConnallonHall2018}. 

Conflicting selection and gene-flow between different classes of individuals, or genetic trade-offs between fitness components, can impose constraints on adaptation with particularly interesting evolutionary consequences \citep{CharlesworthHughes2000, ConnallonHall2018}. Such constraints hinder adaptation by preventing individuals (or classes of individuals) from reaching the phenotypic optimum in one or more fitness components, thereby increasing the population's overall extinction risk. At the same time, they provide an effective mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variation, which in turn influences the population's capactiy for future adaptation \citep{Fisher1930, CharlesworthHughes2000, ConnallonHall2018, MatthewsConnallon2019}. Hence, for genetically constrained traits the nature and extent of genetic variation observed in natural populations should reflect the balance between the contribution of constraints to the maintainance of genetic polymorphisms, and the demographic consequences of the resulting maladaptation.
%Genetic trade-offs between fitness components due to pleiotropy represent a form of genetic constraint with particularly interesting evolutionary consequences because they act as a double-edged sword
%The nature and extent of genetic variation observed in natural populations should therefore reflect the balance between the contribution of those constraints to the maintainance of genetic polymorphism and the demographic consequences of the resulting maladaptation.

Genetic trade-offs between male and female fitness are a common feature of sexually reproducing populations, and are thought to contribute not only to the maintenance of genetic variation, but also the evolution of sexual dimorphism and gender-related traits \citep{Lande1980, Rice1992, Charlesworth1999, RiceChippindale2001, BondurianskyChenoweth2009,Olito2019}. When such genetic trade-offs occur, "sexually antagonistic" selection (abbreviated SA hereafter) can arise when beneficial alleles for one sex are deleterious when expressed in the other \citep{Kidwell1977, Rice1992, ConnallonClark2012}. Moreover, alleles with opposing fitness effects through male and female sex functions create analogous genetic constraints on fitness in hermaphrodite populations, where both maternal and paternal reproductive success contribute jointly to each individuals' overall fitness \citep{LloydWebb1986, WebbLloyd1986, Abbott2011, JordanConnallon2014}. 

The evolutionary dynamics of SA alleles in hermaphrodites differ from those in dioecious populations because individuals may reproduce through a combination of self- and outcross fertilization \citep{Goodwillie2005, Igic2006, JarneAuld2006}. Such mixed-mating systems have important theoretical consequences for the maintenance of SA polymorphisms in hermaphrodite populations. Self-fertilization is predicted to reduce the total parameter space where balanced SA polymorphisms can be maintained, while simultaneously creating a bias in selection through the female sex function (\citealt{JordanConnallon2014}; but see \citealt{Tazzyman2015}. Yet, other processes, such as genetic linkage to other SA loci or a sex-determining region \citep{Otto2011, JordanCharlesworth2012, Olito2017, Olito2019}, or spatial heterogeneity and the complexity of the life-cycle \citep{Olito-etal-2018,ConnallonSharmaOlito2019} can expand the parameter space for SA polymorphism. Overall, both theoretical predictions and current empirical data suggest there is ample scope for SA trade-offs and the maintenance of SA polymorphisms in both dioecious and hermaphrodite populations \citep{Abbott2011, WangBarrett2020}, although identifying specific SA loci from genome sequence data remains challenging \citep{RuzickaESEB2020}.

In this article, we build upon the models of \citet{deVriesCaswell2019a} and \citet{deVriesCaswell2019b} to develop a stage-structured mendelian matrix model that accommodates selection through male and female function in simultaneous hermaphrodites with mixed mating systems. Using the model, we jointly analyze the evolutionary and demographic consequences of SA selection in obligately outcrossing (equivalent to dioecious) and partially selfing hermaphrodite populations. Although a variety of interesting eco-evolutionary dynamics are possible in the model (e.g., \citealt{deVriesCaswell2019a, deVriesCaswell2019b,CaswellEtAl2018}), we focus our analyses on identifying the parameter conditions under which SA polymorphisms are maintained by balancing selection {\itshape and} the population is also demographically viable (i.e., has a positive intrinsic growth rate). The model also allows for the effects of inbreeding depression to manifest in different life-history stages, enabling us to explore the fitness consequences of early- vs.~late-acting inbreeding depression on the model predictions. Finally, we give an illustrative example of the potential for SA polymorphism in real populations by parameterizing our model with empirically estimated demographic rates for the hermaphroditic flowering plant {\itshape Mimulus guttatus} (now {\itshape Erythranthe guttata}).

A key finding from our analysis is that when the intrinsic population growth rate is close to $1$, the deleterious effects of segregating male-beneficial SA alleles on female fecundity can result in extinction over much of the parameter space for SA polymorphism. Furthermore, this demographically viable polymorphic parameter space is often biased towards 'female-beneficial/male-deleterious' SA alleles (i.e., those with weaker selection on the female- than male sex function). Under some conditions, self-fertilization can alleviate the demographic costs of balanced SA polymorphisms, but the concommitant effects of inbreeding depression greatly exacerbate them. Interestingly, our illustrative example using {\itshape M.~guttatus} appears to show that demographic rates observed in real populations can sustain large regions of viable SA polymorphic space. Overall, our findings provide a more nuanced picture of the nature of SA genetic variation that we should expect to find in natural populations, where the fate of SA alleles and the populations harboring them is determined jointly by evolutionary and demographic processes.

\section*{The Model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Here, we briefly derive a matrix model incorporating multiple life-cycle stages and a single diallelic locus under SA selection on male and female sex functions for a population of partially selfing simultaneous hermaphrodites. The derivation and some of the key results follow closely those presented in \citet{deVriesCaswell2019a} and \citet{deVriesCaswell2019b}; and in fact, the model presented here reduces to the two-sex stage-structured model of \citet{deVriesCaswell2019b} under obligate outcrossing. A full derivation of the model and analyses is presented in \hl{Appendix A}, and all simulation code necessary to reproduce the results are available at \url{https://github.com/colin-olito/SA-Hermaphrodites-wDemography}.

In the model, individuals are classified jointly by life-cycle stage ($1, \ldots, \omega$), genotype ($1, \ldots, g$), and whether they were produced by self- or outcross fertilization (denoted by $S$ and $X$ superscripts). Each genotype is characterized by a matrix of transition probabilities (including survival) and a matrix of reproductive output through male and female function. These matrices can include time variation or nonlinearities reflecting the environment or density dependence, but these will not be modelled here. Each stage contributes offspring to genotypes at the next time step according to transition matrices that are determined by the mating system and stage-structure of the population.

The population state at time $t$ is described by a stage $\times$ genotype distribution matrix, which can be transformed into a population state vector, $\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t)$, which is ordered by genotype, then stage, then by how individuals were produced (self vs.~outcrossing). For a single diallelic locus with alleles $A$ and $a$, we have three genotypes ($AA,\, Aa,\, aa$; $g = 3$), giving the population state vector:
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:PopStateVec}
	\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t) =  \left[
								\begin{array}{c}
									\mbf{n}^{S}_{AA}(t) \\
									\mbf{n}^{S}_{Aa}(t) \\
									\mbf{n}^{S}_{aa}(t) \\ \hline
									\mbf{n}^{X}_{AA}(t) \\
									\mbf{n}^{X}_{Aa}(t) \\
									\mbf{n}^{X}_{aa}(t) \\ 
						\end{array} \right],
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent where $\mbf{n}^{S}_{i}$ and $\mbf{n}^{X}_{i}$ ($i \in \{AA,Aa,aa\}$) are the stage $\times$ genotype distribution vectors of individuals produced by self-fertilization and outcrossing, respectively. The proportional population vector is given by
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:propPopVec}
	\tilde{\mbf{p}}(t) = \frac{\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t)}{ \| \tilde{\mbf{n}}(t) \|} = \mbf{p}(t),
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent where $\| \cdot \|$ is the one-norm. The population vector $\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t)$ is projected forward from time $t$ to $t + 1$ by the $projection$ matrix $\tilde{\mbf{A}}(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$ such that 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t + 1) = \tilde{\mbf{A}}[\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t)] \, \tilde{\mbf{n}}(t)
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The population projection matrix $\tilde{\mbf{A}}$ is constructed from four sets of matrices representing the demographic and genetic processes: The matrices $\mbf{U}^{S}_{i}$ and $\mbf{U}^{X}_{i}$ contains transition and survival probabilities for each genotype, produced by selfing and outcrossing respectively. The matrices $\mbf{F}_{i}$ and $\mbf{F}^{\prime}_{i}$ contain the genotype $\times$ stage specific contribution via female and male sex-functions of genotype $i$ to the female and male gamete pools, respectively, and therefore to zygotes in the next generation. In principle, the model can admit any kind of pleiotropy among demographic traits because the transition and fertility matrices can differ among genotypes in any way. For simplicity, we assume linear, time-invariant demography.

Similar to the two-sex model of \citet{deVriesCaswell2019b}, we define the matrices $\mbf{H}^S_{j}(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$ and $\mbf{H}^X_{j}(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$, which map the genotypes of the parent in stage $j$ to the genotypes of their offspring produced by selfing and outcrossing, respectively. The $(k, l)$ entry of $\mbf{H}^{X}_{j}$ and $\mbf{H}^{S}_{i}$ is the probability that an offspring of a genotype $l$ mother, of stage $i$, has genotype $k$. For the purpose of this article, we assume that mating is random with respect to stage and hence that the parent-offspring map is the same for all stages (i.e., $\mbf{H}^S_{j}(\tilde{\mbf{n}}) = \mbf{H}^S(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$, and $\mbf{H}^X_{j}(\tilde{\mbf{n}}) = \mbf{H}^X(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$). The matrices $\mbf{H}^S(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$ and $\mbf{H}^X(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$ contain the population genetic processes and are presented in the next section.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Mating and offspring production under partial selfing}

Simultaneous hermaphrodites express both male and female sex functions (i.e., can be both a mother and father), and have the potential to reproduce by a combination of self- and outcross-fertilizations. Maternal outcrossing involves receiving male gametes from another individual in the population, while paternal outcrossing involves exporting male gametes to another individual and fertilizing their ovules. Self-fertilization is acheived when an individual's male gametes fertilize their own ovules. These modes of reproduction complicate mating in our model relative to the two-sex stage-structured model of \citet{deVriesCaswell2019b}.

Let $C$ denote the proportion of each individual's ovules that are self-fertilized (the remaining $1 - C$ are outcrossed), and $\delta$ represents the proportion of self-fertilized zygotes that fail to develop due to inbreeding depression during early development \citep{Charlesworth1987}. In \hl{Appendix A.x}, we present a more general model of genotype-specific self-fertilization rates (after \citealt{JordanConnallon2014}). Outcrossing proceeds similarly to a two-sex model of reproduction \citep{deVriesCaswell2019b}, except each individual's genotype determines both the number of ovules produced, and also paternal "mating success", broadly defined. For hermaphroditic flowering plants, for example, paternal mating success could reflect pollen production, export efficiency, pollen-tube germination and growth rates, among other things \citep{LloydWebb1986,WangBarrett2020,Harder2016}. Depending on their stage and genotype at the SA locus, individuals contribute male gametes to the overall population gamete pool according to the male stage $\times$ genotype vector:
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
		\mbf{W}^{\prime} \mbb{F}^{\prime} \mbf{p} = 
		\left(
			\begin{array}{ccc}
				\mbf{1}^{\intercal}_{\omega} & \frac{1}{2} \mbf{1}^{\intercal}_{\omega} & 0 \\
				0 & \frac{1}{2} \mbf{1}^{\intercal}_{\omega} & \mbf{1}^{\intercal}_{\omega} \\
			\end{array} \right)
		\left(
			\begin{array}{ccc}
				\mbf{F}^{\prime}_{AA} & 0 & 0 \\
				0 & \mbf{F}^{\prime}_{Aa} & 0 \\
				0 & 0 & \mbf{F}^{\prime}_{aa} \\
			\end{array} \right)
		\left(
			\begin{array}{c}
				\mbf{p}_{AA} \\
				\mbf{p}_{Aa} \\
				\mbf{p}_{aa} \\
			\end{array} \right).
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent The vector $\mbf{p}$ gives the genotype frequencies at mating, and is the sum of $\mbf{n}^{S}$ and $\mbf{n}^{X}$, since in partially selfing popualtions, whether an individual was produced by selfing or outcrossing does not affect whether they can reproduce by outcrossing themselves. The matrix $\mbb{F}^{\prime}$ is composed of genotype-specific fertility matrices, and operates on the the vector of genotype frequencies to give their relative contribution of each genotype to the gamete pool. The matrix $\mbf{W}^{\prime}$ converts these contributions to allele numbers. Normalizing the resulting vector gives the allele frequencies in the male gamete pool:
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:maleGametePool}
	\left(
		\begin{array}{c}
			q^{\prime}_{A} \\
			q^{\prime}_{a} \\
		\end{array} \right) = 
			\frac{\mbf{W}^{\prime} \mbb{F}^{\prime} \mbf{p}}{\| \mbf{W}^{\prime} \mbb{F}^{\prime} \mbf{p} \|} = 
				\frac{\mbf{W}^{\prime} \mbb{F}^{\prime} (\mbf{n}^X + \mbf{n}^S)}{\| \mbf{W}^{\prime} \mbb{F}^{\prime} (\mbf{n}^X + \mbf{n}^S)\|}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The parent-offspring map for outcrossing is a function of the allele frequencies in the male gamete pool, and is given by 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:HX}
	\mbf{H}^X(\tilde{\mbf{n}}) = 
			\left(
			\begin{array}{ccc}
				q^{\prime}_{A} & \frac{1}{2} q^{\prime}_{A} & 0 \\
				q^{\prime}_{a} & \frac{1}{2} & q^{\prime}_{A}  \\
				0 & \frac{1}{2} q^{\prime}_{a} & q^{\prime}_{a} \\
			\end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent From left to right, the columns of matrix $\mbf{H}^X(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$ give the genotype distribution of outcrossed offspring produced by a maternal parent of each genotype ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ respectively).

Reproduction via self-fertilization differs from outcrossing. As in previous models of partial selfing, we assume that individuals produce enough male gametes to easily self-fertilize all of their ovules, and that self-fertilization involves little or no selection from external factors relative to outcrossing (e.g., \citealt{Charlesworth1978a,JordanConnallon2014,Olito2017}, but see \citealt{Tazzyman2015}). Under these assumptions, the genotype distributions of selfed offspring are determined entirely by the parental genotype and the probabilities of segregation and fertilization during meiosis: 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:HS}
	\mbf{H}^S(\tilde{\mbf{n}}) = 
			\left(
			\begin{array}{ccc}
				1 & 1/4 & 0 \\
				0 & 1/2 & 0 \\
				0 & 1/4 & 1 \\
			\end{array} \right).
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent The columns of $\mbf{H}^S(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$ again give the selfed offspring genotype distributions for parental genotypes of $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$, respectively.

\subsubsection*{Population projection}

Using the component matrices described in the previous section, the matrix $\tilde{\mbf{A}}[\tilde{\mbf{n}}]$ that projects the eco-evolutionary dynamics is:
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Atilde}
	\tilde{\mbf{A}}[\tilde{\mbf{n}}] = 
			\underbrace{\left(
			\begin{array}{c|c}
				\mcal{U}^S & \mbf{0} \\ \hline
				\mbf{0} & \mcal{U}^X \\
			\end{array} \right)}_{\tilde{\mbf{U}}} + 
			\underbrace{\left(
			\begin{array}{c|c}
				\mcal{F}^S(\tilde{\mbf{p}}) C(1 - \delta) & \mcal{F}^S(\tilde{\mbf{p}}) C(1 - \delta) \\ \hline
				\mcal{F}^X(\tilde{\mbf{p}}) (1 - C) & \mcal{F}^X(\tilde{\mbf{p}}) (1 - C)\\
			\end{array} \right)}_{\tilde{\mbf{F}}}.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent The blocks of the component matrices in Eq(\ref{eq:Atilde}) correspond to production of offspring by self-fertilization and outcrossing ($\mcal{F}^S$ and $\mcal{F}^X$ in $\tilde{\mbf{F}}$), and survival of selfed and outcrossed offspring ($\mcal{U}^S$ and $\mcal{U}^X$ in $\tilde{\mbf{U}}$). 

We construct $\tilde{\mbf{A}}[\tilde{\mbf{n}}]$ using the vec-permutation approach of \citet{CaswellEtAl2018}. Briefly, we construct a set of block-diagonal matrices: e.g.,
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:BlkUS}
	\mbb{U}^S = 
		\left(
			\begin{array}{ccc}
				\mbf{U}^{S}_{AA} & \mbf{0} & \mbf{0} \\
				\mbf{0} & \mbf{U}^{S}_{Aa} & \mbf{0} \\
				\mbf{0} & \mbf{0} & \mbf{U}^{S}_{aa} \\
			\end{array} \right),
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent and corresponding matrices $\mbb{U}^X$, $\mbb{F}^S$, $\mbb{F}^X$. Since individuals cannot change their genotype once they are born, the survival matrices are block diagonal, and $\mcal{U}^S = \mbb{U}^S$ and $\mcal{U}^X = \mbb{U}^X$. 

Similarly, we also construct block-diagonal matrices
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
	\mbb{H}^j = \mbf{I}_{\omega} \otimes \mbf{H}^j(\tilde{\mbf{p}}),
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent where $j \in \{S,X\}$. The corresponding fertility matrices for self-fertilization and outcrossing are defined as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:BlkFS}
	\mcal{F}^S = \mbf{K}^{\intercal} \mbb{H}^S(\tilde{\mbf{p}}) \mbf{K} \mbb{F}^S = 
			\left(
			\begin{array}{ccc}
				\mbf{F}_{AA} & \frac{1}{4} \mbf{F}_{Aa} & 0 \\
				0 & \frac{1}{2} \mbf{F}_{Aa} & 0 \\
				0 & \frac{1}{4} \mbf{F}_{Aa} & \mbf{F}_{aa}\\
			\end{array} \right), 
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
\noindent and 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:BlkFX}
	\mcal{F}^X = \mbf{K}^{\intercal} \mbb{H}^X(\tilde{\mbf{p}}) \mbf{K} \mbb{F}^X = 
			\left(
			\begin{array}{ccc}
				q^{\prime}_{A} \mbf{F}_{AA} & \frac{1}{2} q^{\prime}_{A} \mbf{F}_{Aa} & 0 \\ 
				q^{\prime}_{a} \mbf{F}_{AA} & \frac{1}{2} \mbf{F}_{Aa} & q^{\prime}_{A} \mbf{F}_{aa}  \\ 
				0 & \frac{1}{2} q^{\prime}_{a} \mbf{F}_{Aa} & q^{\prime}_{a} \mbf{F}_{aa}  \\
			\end{array} \right),
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent where $q^{\prime}_A$ and $q^{\prime}_a$ are given by Eq(\ref{eq:maleGametePool}), and $\mbf{K}$ is the vec-permutation matrix \citep{HendersonSearle1981}. Further details of the derivations of $\mcal{F}^S$ and $\mcal{F}^X$ are provided in \hl{Appendix A.x}. 

The blocks of $\mcal{F}^X(\tilde{\mbf{p}})$ can be constructed and interpreted as follows: The first row block of the first column produces $AA$ offspring by outcrossing from $AA$ maternal parents. This happens when the $AA$ maternal parent receives a random gamete from the male gamete pool, which happens with probability $q^{\prime}_{A}$. The other blocks can be interpreted similarly.

Combining all the component matrices yields the overall eco-evolutionary projection matrix shown in \hl{Reference a Box here?  or possibly Appendix A.x?}

\subsection*{Sexually antagonistic selection \& inbreeding depression} \label{sec:SAsel}

We now construct and analyze a genotype $\times$stage-classified model for a hypothetical species with intralocus sexual conflict via the two sex functions. To keep the model analytically tractable, we assume our hypothetical species has two life stages: juveniles and adults (i.e., $\omega = 2$), and that only adults are reproductively active. Suppose that there is a genetic trade-off between the sex-functions at a single bi-allelic locus such that allele $A$ is beneficial for female fertility but detrimental for male reproductive success (e.g., pollen production), and that allele $a$ has the reverse effect. Following convention, we parameterize the relative fitnesses of each genotype through each sex function ($w_{i}$ and $w^{\prime}_{i}$) to be bounded by $(0,1)$, with dominance and selection coefficients $h_f, s_f$ and $h_m, s_m$ determining the decrease in fertility through each sex function relative to the most fit genotype ($AA$ has highest female fertility, $aa$ the highest male fertility; see Table \ref{tab:Fitness}). The SA locus does not affect survival and transition rates. However, the survival matrices can be used to model the fitness effects of inbreeding depression at later stages of development by allowing different stage-specific survival and transition rates for individuals produced by self-fertilization vs.~outcrossing. By contrast, the parameter $\sigma$ only affects inbreeding depression through viability of selfed ovlues. With this in mind, we define survival matrices for individuals produced by selfing and outcrossing as follows:
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:US}
	\mbf{U}^S = \left(
					\begin{array}{cc}
						\sigma^S_J (1 - \delta_J) \big(1 - \gamma^S (1 - \delta_{\gamma}) \big) & 0 \\
						\sigma^S_J (1 - \delta_J) \gamma (1 - \delta_{\gamma})      & \sigma^S_A (1 - \delta_S)
					\end{array}
				\right) \\
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
\noindent and 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:UX}
	\mbf{U}^X = \left(
					\begin{array}{cc}
						\sigma^X_J(1 - \gamma^X) & 0 \\
						\sigma^X_J \gamma      & \sigma^X_A
					\end{array}
				\right)
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent where $\sigma_J$ and $\sigma_A$ are the juvenile and adult stage survival rates, $\gamma$ is the maturation rate from juvenile to adult stages, and the corresponding $\delta_S$, $\delta_A$, and $\delta_{\gamma}$ terms denote the proportional decreases in stage-specific survival and transition rates due to inbreeding depression (i.e., deleterious effects of inbreeding at later life-history stages; e.g., \citealt{HarderRoutely2006}). Any or all of these parameters may differ among genotypes, so that selection can operate on stage-specific viability, development, and/or fertility. For simplicity, we assume these are constant among genotypes. 

The fertility matrices through female and male function are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:FS}
	\mbf{F}_{i} = \left(
					\begin{array}{cc}
						0 & f w_{i} \\
						0 & 0
					\end{array}
				\right),
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
\noindent and
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:FX}
	\mbf{F}^{\prime}_{i} = \left(
					\begin{array}{cc}
						0 & f^{\prime} w^{\prime}_{i} \\
						0 & 0
					\end{array}
				\right),
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent where $f$ and $f^{\prime}$ represent adult fertilities, and $w_{i}$ and $w^{\prime}_{i}$ the genotypic relative fitness expressions for female and male sex-functions (see Table \ref{tab:Fitness}). 

\begin{table}[htbp]
 \centering
 \caption{\bf Fitness expressions for Sexually Antagonistic selection in hermaphrodites ()}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Iterating the projection matrix, Eq(\ref{eq:Atilde}) with the above demographic matrices, given an initial population state vector, Eq(\ref{eq:PopStateVec}), allows numerical simulation of the eco-evolutionary dynamics for selection operating on any of the sex-function, or stage-specific demographic parameters. As we outline below, we use numerical techniques together with mathematical analyses to study the conditions for the maintenance of SA polymorphisms, and the demographic fate of the populations (i.e., positive growth, or extinction).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Analyses} \label{sec:analyses}

Diverse eco-evolutionary outcomes are possible in the model, including fixation of either allele, balanced polymorphism, population growth or extinction, and even evolutionary rescue and suicide (e.g., see \citealt{CaswellEtAl2018,deVriesCaswell2019a,deVriesCaswell2019b}). We focus on identifying parameter conditions where two criteria are satisfied: ({\itshape i}) SA polymorphism is maintained under balancing selection and ({\itshape ii}) the intrinsic population growth rate at equilibrium is positive; a situation that we refer to as a 'demographically viable SA polymorphism'.

We identify conditions where SA polymorphism is 'protected' by evaluating the stability of populations initially fixed for either SA allele to invasion by the other (i.e., stability was assessed at the boundary equilibrium allele frequencies of $\hat{\mbf{p}}_{AA} = 1$ and $\hat{\mbf{p}}_{aa} = 1$; \citealt{Levene1953, Prout1968, deVriesCaswell2019b}). The formal conditions for a protected polymorphism are determined by linearizing the model in the vacinity of the boundary equilibria ($\hat{\mbf{p}}$), and evaluating the magnitude of the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix of the linearization, which we denote $\tilde{\zeta}_{AA}$ and $\tilde{\zeta}_{aa}$. For our model, $\mbf{M}$ has an upper block triangular form, and we can therefore express the stability of $\hat{\mbf{p}}$ in terms of the leading eigenvalue of the diagonal block corresponding to changes in heterozygote frequency ($\mbf{M}_{22}$; e.g., see \citealt{OttoDay2007,deVriesCaswell2019b}). For a polymorphism to be 'protected', both boundary equilibria must be unstable (i.e., $\tilde{\zeta}_{AA} > 1$ and $\tilde{\zeta}_{aa} > 1$), which requires that
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:PolyCond}
	1 < \frac{\rho(\mbf{M}_{22})}{\lambda_{i}}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent is satisfied, where $\rho(\cdot)$ represents the spectral radius, and $\lambda_i$ is the intrinsic growth rate for the homozygous genotype being invaded at each boundary ($i \in (AA,aa)$; see Box.~1). A full derivation of the Jacobian and details of the invasion analysis are provided in \hl{Online Appendix X.x}.

We used numerical simulation to determine whether a protected SA polymorphism was also demographically viable. Specifically, for each boundary equilibrium we introduced the rare allele at low initial frequency, and iterated Eq(\ref{eq:Atilde}) until the population had reached demographic and genotypic equilibrium. In our model, the population state vector will grow or shrink exponentially after converging to stable population structure and genotypic frequencies (see \citealt{Caswell2001}), and the intrinsic population growth rate, $\lambda$, can be calculated as $\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t)/\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t-1)$, where $t$ is the final generation of the simulation. We note, however, that if the ecological component of the model is non-linear, more exotic dynamics are possible.

Unfortunately, closed-form solutions for the invasion conditions for each allele and the equilibrium frequencies under different selection scenarios are analytically intractable except for very restricted conditions (see \hl{Online Appendix X}). We therefore used numerical techniques to identify invasion and extinction thresholds, which could then be used to define regions of demographically viable polymorphism across $s_f \times s_m$ parameter space. Because single-locus selection coefficients are generally weak, we limit our analyses to coefficients with within the open interval $\left(0,0.15\right)$, unless stated otherwise. For a given parameter set, we numerically evaluated Eq(\ref{eq:PolyCond}) and $\lambda$, starting at the outer boundaries of selection parameter space, and titrated inward to identify thresholds where $\tilde{\zeta}_i \approx 1$ and $\lambda \approx 1$ (with precision of $10^{-5}$). The proportions of total $s_f \times s_m$ parameter space where SA polymorphism and/or extinction occurred were calculated by numerically integrating the appropriate regions defined by the invasion and extinction thresholds

Balanced SA polymorphisms can be maintained in the funnel-shaped region between the invasion conditions for each SA allele (dark solid lines). However, for some parameter conditions, populations will ultimately go extinct (red shaded regions) due to reduced female fitness resulting from the male-beneficial/female-deleterious allele that is either segregating as a balanced polymorphism (inside the funnel), or becomes fixed (area below the funnel). We are particularly interested in identifying and quantifying "demographically viable polymorphic parameter space", which corresponds to the area inside the funnel that is also to the left of the extinction threshold for a given fertility value. Results are shown for three different population selfing rates ($C = \{0,\,1/4,\,1/2\}$), and two dominance scenarios (additivity with $h = 1/2$, and dominance reversal with $h = 1/4$); extinction thresholds are illustrated for three different values of female fecundity ($f$ values annotated on each panel).}}
