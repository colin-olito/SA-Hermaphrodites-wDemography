\section*{Outline}

OK, just putting some ideas out here based roughly on our conversations about an {\itshape AmNat}-style article, the results we have so far, and what I think we should be able to do with data from COMPADRE. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf Introduction}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Briefly introduce sexual antagonism and intra-locus sexual conflict. (Colin)
		\item Simultaneous hermaphrodites, mixed mating systems, unique predictions for SA polymorphism. (Colin)
		\item Introduce Evolutionary Demography, pivot to focus on the consequences of taking demography into account explicitly for the maintenance of SA polymorphism. (Lotte)
		\item Introduce key difference between existing population genetic models of SA polymorphism and our models: possibility of diverse population and evolutionary dynamics. (Lotte then Colin)
		\item Explain and highlight "demographically viable" parameter space, indicate that we are interested in whether parameter space predicted to be polymorphic by Pop.~gen.~models is, indeed, "demographically viable" (Lotte then Colin)
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Pop. Gen. models tacitly assume stable population size, parameterize genotypic fitnesses relative to the 'best performing' genotype. Non-overlapping generations. Casually define fitness as lifetime reproductive fitness of a given genotype.
			\item "In practice, these genotypic fitnesses emerge from myriad process acting throughout the life-history of individuals"
			\item these processes contribute to key demographic rates such as the intrinsic population growth rate, 
			\item 
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Building upon the two-sex stage-structured matrix models developed by \citet{deVriesCaswell2019a,deVriesCaswell2019b}, we develop stage-structured matrix models that can accommodate selection through male and female function in simultaneous hermaphrodites with mixed mating systems. The models also allow for the effects of inbreeding depression to manifest in several demographic parameters, allowing us to explore the fitness consequences of early- vs.~late-acting inbreeding depression. (Colin then Lotte)
	\end{enumerate}

	\item {\bf Methods}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Citation heavy review of de Vries \& Caswell AmNat (2018) \& de Vries \& Caswell AmNat (2019) TheorPopBiol
			\item Briefly describe extension to simultaneous hermaphrodites, citing Jordan \& Connallon (2014), Abbot \& Tazzyman (2014), Olito (2017). 
			\item Breakdown into individuals produced by selfing vs.~outcrossing.
			\item Brief anatomy of $\mathbf{\tilde{A}}$.
			\item Analysis. Invasion analysis \& abridged derivation of invasion conditions \& identification of extinction threholds.
			\item Cite Appendix with full derivation distilled from notes file.
		\end{enumerate}

	\item {\bf When is polymorphism demographically viable?}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Review previous predictions for outcrossers \& partial selfing
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Greater scope for SA polymorphism in outcrossers vs.~selfers
			\item Greater scope for SA polymorphism when SA fitness effects are recessive (dominance reversal).
			\item but our model allows us to see where/when invasion of SA alleles can drive the population extinct
			\item \textbf{Fig.1 - illustration of funnel plots w/ extinction isoclines}
		\end{enumerate}

		\item Key results summarized in \textbf{Fig.~2}: 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item For simplicity, temporarily assume no inbreeding depression ($\delta = 0$).
			\item When populations do not have high growth-rates (i.e., when $\lambda \approx 1$), much of of polymorphic parameter space becomes demographically inviable.
			\item Specifically, would-be polymorphic paramter space becomes inviable when segregating male-beneficial/female-deleterious alleles can reduce fecundity enough to drive the population extinct.
			\item This effect is most dramatic for separate-sexed species and predominant outcrossers. Selfing shelters the population from the female-deleterious fitness effects because there is no opportunity for selection via male function. This can also be thought of as reproductive assurance in our model....
			\item Convergence to pop.~gen.~predictions when $f$ is big.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item {\bf Effects of inbreeding depression}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Review effect of I.D.~in population genetic models: causes selfing populations to look more like outcrossing ones (at least in terms of where SA polymorphism is maintained). This is because a fraction of selfed ovules are aborted, meaning the overall ratio of outcrossed vs.~selfed progeny increases.
		\item Matrix model allows us to explore effects of I.D. in different parts of the life-cycle (early- vs.~late-acting I.D.). Point out that previous pop.~gen.~models only address early-acting I.D. via ovule viability.
		\item MAKE CLEAR that purging of deleterious recessives thought to cause I.D. is already included in the model results presented in Fig.~3
		\item Key results summarized in Fig.~3
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Pop.~Gen.~models predict that higher early-acting ID should lead to greater proportion of polymorphic parameter space, while our models predict that we get a critical threshold of selfing at which population viability plummets.
			\item When and how I.D. influences fitness during the life-cyclecan change the location and steepness of the decline in polymorphic parameter space.
			\item Critically, largest deviations from pop.~gen.~predictions happen for predominantly selfing populations.
			\item A perhaps obvious, but sometimes overlooked implication of our model predictions: selfing can offer reproductive assurance, and SA polymorphisms can be maintained in a non-trivial proportion of parameter space in partially selfing populations... BUT demographically, the population must be able to "afford" the loss of selfed ovules/offspring.
			\item HIGHLIGHT that this result holds even though we incorporated decrease of the mutation load due to inbreeding (and corresponding decrease in I.D.)...	
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item {\bf Mimulus as a potential real world example}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We can parameterize our model with real populations' demographic rates, and make explicit predictions regarding the opportunity for SA polymorphism given the species' demography. We provide two illustrative examples:
		\item Opportunities for SA polymorphism in {\itshape Mimulus guttatus} (now {\itshape Erythranthe guttata})
		\item Possibly use data from \citet{PetersonEtAl2016} Eagle Meadows population, which is the 'local' population in their big common garden local adaptation expeirment.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Illustrate funnel plot using {\itshape E.~gutatta} demographic rates.
			\item \textbf{Fig.~4}: PLOT inversion from \citet{LeeKelly2015}, on that funnel!
		\end{enumerate}

	\end{enumerate}

	\item Discussion
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Classic prediction from demography that most species should have a $\lambda \approx 1$
			\item If true, the demographic impacts on the opportunities for the maintenance of sexually antagonistic polymorphisms may be pervasive...
			\item Condition dependence, fecundity, scope for sexual confict/antagonistic polymorphism?
			\item Do sexually dimorphic species exhibit demographic rates that increase opportunities for SA polymorphism?

\section*{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Whether a population persists or goes extinct depends in large part on its ability to adapt to the environment. Yet, the process of adaptation can be impeded by a variety of genetic and environmental factors, including deleterious mutations \citep{Haldane1957}, environmental shifts causing a population to chase a new phenotypic optimum \citep{Maynard-Smith1976, LandeShannon1996,OrrUnckless2008}, maladaptive gene-flow \citep{KirkpatrickBarton1997, BolnickNosil2007}, as well as genetic constraints arising from intrinsic features of the inheritance system \citep{ConnallonHall2018}. 

Conflicting selection and gene-flow between different classes of individuals, or genetic trade-offs between fitness components, can impose constraints on adaptation with particularly interesting evolutionary consequences \citep{CharlesworthHughes2000, ConnallonHall2018}. Such constraints hinder adaptation by preventing individuals (or classes of individuals) from reaching the phenotypic optimum in one or more fitness components, thereby increasing the population's overall extinction risk. At the same time, they provide an effective mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variation, which in turn influences the population's capactiy for future adaptation \citep{Fisher1930, CharlesworthHughes2000, ConnallonHall2018, MatthewsConnallon2019}. Hence, for genetically constrained traits the nature and extent of genetic variation observed in natural populations should reflect the balance between the contribution of constraints to the maintainance of genetic polymorphisms, and the demographic consequences of the resulting maladaptation.
%Genetic trade-offs between fitness components due to pleiotropy represent a form of genetic constraint with particularly interesting evolutionary consequences because they act as a double-edged sword
%The nature and extent of genetic variation observed in natural populations should therefore reflect the balance between the contribution of those constraints to the maintainance of genetic polymorphism and the demographic consequences of the resulting maladaptation.

Genetic trade-offs between male and female fitness are a common feature of sexually reproducing populations, and are thought to contribute not only to the maintenance of genetic variation, but also the evolution of sexual dimorphism and gender-related traits \citep{Lande1980, Rice1992, Charlesworth1999, RiceChippindale2001, BondurianskyChenoweth2009,Olito2019}. When such genetic trade-offs occur, "sexually antagonistic" selection (abbreviated SA hereafter) can arise when beneficial alleles for one sex are deleterious when expressed in the other \citep{Kidwell1977, Rice1992, ConnallonClark2012}. Moreover, alleles with opposing fitness effects through male and female sex functions create analogous genetic constraints on fitness in hermaphrodite populations, where both maternal and paternal reproductive success contribute jointly to each individuals' overall fitness \citep{LloydWebb1986, WebbLloyd1986, Abbott2011, JordanConnallon2014}. 

The evolutionary dynamics of SA alleles in hermaphrodites differ from those in dioecious populations because individuals may reproduce through a combination of self- and outcross fertilization \citep{Goodwillie2005, Igic2006, JarneAuld2006}. Such mixed-mating systems have important theoretical consequences for the maintenance of SA polymorphisms in hermaphrodite populations. Self-fertilization is predicted to reduce the total parameter space where balanced SA polymorphisms can be maintained, while simultaneously creating a bias in selection through the female sex function (\citealt{JordanConnallon2014}; but see \citealt{Tazzyman2015}. Yet, other processes, such as genetic linkage to other SA loci or a sex-determining region \citep{Otto2011, JordanCharlesworth2012, Olito2017, Olito2019}, or spatial heterogeneity and the complexity of the life-cycle \citep{Olito-etal-2018,ConnallonSharmaOlito2019} can expand the parameter space for SA polymorphism. Overall, both theoretical predictions and current empirical data suggest there is ample scope for SA trade-offs and the maintenance of SA polymorphisms in both dioecious and hermaphrodite populations \citep{Abbott2011, WangBarrett2020}, although identifying specific SA loci from genome sequence data remains challenging \citep{RuzickaESEB2020}.

In this article, we build upon the models of \citet{deVriesCaswell2019a} and \citet{deVriesCaswell2019b} to develop a stage-structured mendelian matrix model that accommodates selection through male and female function in simultaneous hermaphrodites with mixed mating systems. Using the model, we jointly analyze the evolutionary and demographic consequences of SA selection in obligately outcrossing (equivalent to dioecious) and partially selfing hermaphrodite populations. We focus our analyses on identifying the parameter conditions under which SA polymorphisms are maintained by balancing selection {\itshape and} the population is also demographically viable (i.e., has a positive intrinsic growth rate). The model also allows for the effects of inbreeding depression to manifest in different life-history stages, enabling us to explore the fitness consequences of early- vs.~late-acting inbreeding depression on the model predictions.

A key finding from our analysis is that when the intrinsic population growth rate is close to $1$, the deleterious effects of segregating male-beneficial SA alleles on female fecundity can result in extinction over much of the parameter space for SA polymorphism. Furthermore, this demographically viable polymorphic parameter space is often biased towards 'female-beneficial/male-deleterious' SA alleles (i.e., those with weaker selection on the female- than male sex function). Under some conditions, self-fertilization can alleviate the demographic costs of balanced SA polymorphisms, but the concommitant effects of inbreeding depression greatly exacerbate them. Overall, our findings provide a more nuanced picture of the nature of SA genetic variation that we should expect to find in natural populations, where the fate of SA alleles and the populations harboring them is determined jointly by evolutionary and demographic processes.

\section*{The Model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Here, we briefly derive a matrix model incorporating multiple life-cycle stages and a single bi-allelic locus under SA selection on male and female sex functions for a population of partially selfing simultaneous hermaphrodites. The derivation and some of the key results follow closely those presented in \citet{deVriesCaswell2019a} and \citet{deVriesCaswell2019b}; and in fact, the model presented here reduces to the two-sex stage-structured model of \citet{deVriesCaswell2019b} under obligate outcrossing. A full derivation of the model and analyses is presented in \hl{Appendix A}, and all simulation code necessary to reproduce the results are available at \url{https://github.com/colin-olito/SA-Hermaphrodites-wDemography}.

In the model, individuals are classified jointly by life-cycle stage ($1, \ldots, \omega$), genotype ($1, \ldots, g$), and whether they were produced by self- or outcross fertilization (denoted by $S$ and $X$ superscripts). Each genotype is characterized by a matrix of transition probabilities (including survival) and a matrix of reproductive output through male and female function. These matrices can include time variation or nonlinearities reflecting the environment or density dependence, but these will not be modelled here. Each stage contributes offspring to genotypes at the next time step according to transition matrices that are determined by the mating system and stage-structure of the population.

The population state at time $t$ is described by a stage $\times$ genotype distribution matrix, which can be transformed into a population state vector, $\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t)$, which is ordered by genotype, then stage, then by how individuals were produced (self vs.~outcrossing). For a single locus with two alleles ($A$ and $a$), we have genotypes $g \in \{AA,\, Aa,\, aa\}$, giving the population state vector:
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t) =  \left[
								\begin{array}{c}
									\mbf{n}^{S}_{AA}(t) \\
									\mbf{n}^{S}_{Aa}(t) \\
									\mbf{n}^{S}_{aa}(t) \\ \hline
									\mbf{n}^{X}_{AA}(t) \\
									\mbf{n}^{X}_{Aa}(t) \\
									\mbf{n}^{X}_{aa}(t) \\ 
						\end{array} \right],
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent where $\mbf{n}^{S}_{i}$ and $\mbf{n}^{X}_{i}$ (where $i \in \{AA,Aa,aa\}$) are the stage $\times$ genotype distribution vectors of individuals produced by self-fertilization and outcrossing, respectively. The proportional population vector is given by
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:propPopVec}
	\tilde{\mbf{p}}(t) = \frac{\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t)}{ \| \tilde{\mbf{n}}(t) \|} = \mbf{p}(t),
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent where $\| \cdot \|$ is the one-norm. The population vector $\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t)$ is projected forward from time $t$ to $t + 1$ by the $projection$ matrix $\tilde{\mbf{A}}(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$ such that 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t + 1) = \tilde{\mbf{A}}[\tilde{\mbf{n}}(t)] \, \tilde{\mbf{n}}(t)
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The population projection matrix $\tilde{\mbf{A}}$ is constructed from four sets of matrices representing the demographic and genetic processes: The matrices $\mbf{U}^{S}_{i}$ and $\mbf{U}^{X}_{i}$ contains transition and survival probabilities for each genotype, produced by selfing and outcrossing respectively. The matrices $\mbf{F}_{i}$ and $\mbf{F}^{\prime}_{i}$ contain the genotype $\times$ stage specific contribution via female and male sex-functions of genotype $i$ to the female and male gamete pools, respectively, and therefore to zygotes in the next generation. In principle, the model can admit any kind of pleiotropy among demographic traits because the transition and fertility matrices can differ among genotypes in any way. For simplicity, we assume linear, time-invariant demography.

Similar to the two-sex model of \citet{deVriesCaswell2019b}, we define the matrices $\mbf{H}^S_{j}(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$ and $\mbf{H}^X_{j}(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$, which map the genotypes of the parent in stage $j$ to the genotypes of their offspring produced by selfing and outcrossing, respectively. The $(k, l)$ entry of $\mbf{H}^{X}_{j}$ and $\mbf{H}^{S}_{i}$ is the probability that an offspring of a genotype $l$ mother, of stage $i$, has genotype $k$. For the purpose of this article, we assume that mating is random with respect to stage and hence that the parent-offspring map is the same for all stages (i.e., $\mbf{H}^S_{j}(\tilde{\mbf{n}}) = \mbf{H}^S(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$, and $\mbf{H}^X_{j}(\tilde{\mbf{n}}) = \mbf{H}^X(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$). The matrices $\mbf{H}^S(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$ and $\mbf{H}^X(\tilde{\mbf{n}})$ contain the population genetic processes and are presented in the next section.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Mating and offspring production under partial selfing}

Simultaneous hermaphrodites express both male and female sex functions (i.e., can be both a mother and father), and have the potential to reproduce by a combination of self- and outcross-fertilizations. Maternal outcrossing involves receiving male gametes from another individual in the population, while paternal outcrossing involves exporting male gametes to another individual and fertilizing their ovules. Self-fertilization is acheived when an individual's male gametes fertilize their own ovules. These modes of reproduction complicate mating in our model relative to the two-sex stage-structured model of \citet{deVriesCaswell2019b}.

Let $C$ denote the proportion of each individual's ovules that are self-fertilized (the remaining $1 - C$ are outcrossed), and $\delta$ represent the viability cost suffered by self-fertilized offspring due to inbreeding depression \citep{Charlesworth1987}. In \hl{Appendix A.x}, we present a more general model of genotype-specific self-fertilization rates (after \citealt{JordanConnallon2014}). Outcrossing proceeds similarly to a two-sex model of reproduction \citep{deVriesCaswell2019b}, where the number of offspring is determined by the maternal genotype, while the male genotype determines paternal "mating success".

 \caption{Illustration of parameter space for SA polymorphism and extinction thresholds predicted by the mendelian stage-structured matrix model. Balanced SA polymorphisms can be maintained in the funnel-shaped region between the invasion conditions for each SA allele (dark solid lines). However, for some parameter conditions, populations will ultimately go extinct (red shaded regions) due to reduced female fitness resulting from the male-beneficial/female-deleterious allele that is either segregating as a balanced polymorphism (inside the funnel), or becomes fixed (area below the funnel). We are particularly interested in identifying and quantifying "demographically viable polymorphic parameter space", which corresponds to the area inside the funnel that is also to the left of the extinction threshold for a given fertility value. Results are shown for three different population selfing rates ($C = \{0,\,1/4,\,1/2\}$), and two dominance scenarios (additivity with $h = 1/2$, and dominance reversal with $h = 1/4$); extinction thresholds are illustrated for three different values of female fecundity ($f$ values annotated on each panel). }

The quick red fox began jumping over the lazy brown dog in the 19th century and has never ceased from so jumping, as we shall see in figure~\ref{Fig:Jumps}. But there can be surprises (figure~\ref{Fig:JumpsOk}).

If the order and location of figures is not otherwise clear, feel free to include explanatory dummy text like this:

[Figure A1 goes here.]

[Figure A2 goes here.]

\subsection*{Further insights}

Tables in the appendices can appear in the appendix text (see table~\ref{Table:Rivers} for an example), unlike appendix figure legends which should be grouped at the end of the document together with the other figure legends.
